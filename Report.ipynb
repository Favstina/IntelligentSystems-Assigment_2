    "The goal of this assigment was to develop an NLP system that would be able to detect contadictions in legal documents. We were provided with two datasets, we chose to work with the English one.         \n",
    "We firstly prepared the dataset, so it we could use it for training. Then we tried several traditional machine learning methods, to see which worked best. In third task we used deep learning - we used BERT for classification. Lastly, we trained a custom sentence transformer model that generated embeddings for legal text sections."
